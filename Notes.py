How does intehration work with the agent and problems faced and resolved:

how to set up agents
how to test tjem
how triage agents work
how tools work with agents
if i provide the agent with a prompt and tool does it automatically convert the prompt into different types of arguments according to the tool input

if i am calling a bookungs function extrenally in an agent class, I need to make a tool function for that
how to design a tool function if the bookings function takes input as a pydantic model

does agent automatically convert the input prompt into a pydantic model or does it convert it into simple data types?
Maybe simple datatypes then u create a model in the tool and then pass it to the main function as a model
